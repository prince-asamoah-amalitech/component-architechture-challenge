## Objective

- This challenge is to help devs utilize core concepts of the framework to be used.

- The challenge is also geared towards the design and architecture of components that are reusable and scalable.

- Welcome various implementation techniques for learning and discussion.

## Tasks

Design and develop the various screens for the userâ€™s onboarding with any choice of framework

On each screen, render a different image as in the design or any other transparent background image of your choice

Add to your README file a description of your approach to meeting this requirement

## Delimitations

The forms and their interaction are not important. Focus on the functionality of switching from one screen to the other.
